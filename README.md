## Personal Website - Project for the course Web Design Fundamentals - FINKI 

- I made this project at the end of listening to the course in 2021.

- I used flexbox for the layout, the navbar is fixed while scrolling
- I added audio meant to be played while the site is viewed
- I used different kinds of CSS selectors to style the elements
